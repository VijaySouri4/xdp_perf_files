Traffic:

burstreplay

in hs callback use bpf counters to calculate how many founds. 

Then return the traffic so that the traffic checker can check the throughput

XDP tx

Comparision:

use Ring buffer also. 

Use DPDK

1. Email prof sudarshan about thesis -- Done
2. Find regex rules set
3. scapy traffic generator

remove + + from the regex list 


1. measure variance
2. fix the CPU clock frequencies[https://github.com/smartnic/bpf-profile/blob/main/setup/set_cpu_freq.sh]
[https://github.com/smartnic/bpf-profile/blob/main/setup/constant_freq.sh]
3. Use data trace: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tbenson/IMC10_Data.html â€” use data center traces with tcpreplay
https://7h3ram.github.io/posts/20141115_pcapedit.html
4. measuring with different ruleset sizes
5. relate throughput  to the difference in times between two packets: tcpdump

6. understand 2x increase in processing time for hs_scan from pure userspace buffer to userspace + perf buffers from bpf
